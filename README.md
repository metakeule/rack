rack for go - inspired by ruby rack from chneukirchen 

see wrapper directory to get an idea, how to write a wrapper
see example directory to know how to use it

**This was the now deprecated ancestor of the [go-on/wrap](http://github.com/go-on/wrap)
library. Please use that one - it is well maintained and should not have
any API changes in the future (fingers crossed).**

I just leave the repo, so that anyone depending on it will not get 
angry. But I guess, I will delete it in a year or so...
